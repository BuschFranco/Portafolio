#### CRM Dynamics 365

Using JavaScript and C#, I have created various custom solutions in Dynamics 365 CRM designed to enhance functionality and user experience. Some examples include:

Experience in creating custom plugins for WordPress, using PHP to develop interactive and functional solutions. Some functionalities include:

My focus is on providing tools that optimize site functionality and security, ensuring optimal performance and a better user experience.

#### Web Development

I have undertaken various practice projects to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In these projects, I used frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Node.js, and integrated APIs and other tools.

It is worth noting that these pages were created for practical purposes, so some are incomplete or unfinished, and they are not worth highlighting individually. However, these developments have allowed me to apply and refine my knowledge of web technologies in a practical and effective manner.
