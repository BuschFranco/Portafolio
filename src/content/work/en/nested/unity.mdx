#### Video Game Development with Unity

My approach to game development in Unity combines creativity with technology to create an engaging and entertaining experience. I use Unity to build an arcade game with hack and slash elements, all with a 3D pixel art visual style that brings both nostalgia and beauty.

At the heart of the development are Unity's powerful tools, allowing me to create 3D graphics, smooth animations, and realistic physics. I program in C# to implement game logic, from character behavior to player interaction with the environment.

For the hack and slash aspect, I leverage Unity's capabilities to manage dynamic combat systems and design levels that strategically challenge players.

Using pixel art in 3D environments combines retro charm with modern gameplay and efficient game performance optimization across different platforms. This ensures not only a visually appealing experience but also guarantees that my games run smoothly on a variety of devices.

In summary, my focus on Unity is not just on the technical creation of games but also on crafting gaming experiences that entertain players.

#### Previously
Previously, I developed a horror video game (or at least an attempt at horror, haha!) where players must navigate through a forest at night while being chased by an enemy. This project included survival components, offering a more thrilling experience.
