#### ERP Application Development in D365
Working in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations is an experience that combines advanced technology with agile development strategies. In this environment, we use technologies such as X++, C#, and JavaScript to build robust and customized financial solutions.

We manage the development of the application using DevOps for code control, continuous integration, and automated deployment. This methodology ensures that our team maintains efficient collaboration, managing versions and updates in a coordinated and uninterrupted manner.

Teamwork is fundamental in this environment, where I collaborated closely with junior, semi-senior, and senior developers, as well as with testing teams and end-users. Together, we overcame complex challenges such as optimizing financial processes, integrating new functionalities, and adapting to changing business needs.

In addition to programming and application development, part of my role involved designing scalable architectures that support the growth and expansion of our solutions in Dynamics 365. This involves considering security, performance, and usability at every stage of development.

In summary, working in Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations requires not only technical skills but also the ability to collaborate effectively, manage complex projects, and stay updated with development practices. It is a dynamic environment where innovation and commitment to excellence were crucial for the success of the project and client satisfaction.
